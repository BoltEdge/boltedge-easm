# Nano EASM — Project Context for Claude Code

## What This Is
Nano EASM (nanoeasm.com) is an External Attack Surface Management platform. Users add root domains, the system discovers assets (subdomains, IPs, services), scans them for vulnerabilities, scores exposure risk, and provides continuous monitoring with alerting.

## Domain & Branding
- **Product name:** Nano EASM (was previously "BoltEdge EASM" — fully rebranded April 2026)
- **Production URL:** https://nanoeasm.com
- **No references to "BoltEdge" should exist anywhere in the codebase**
- **Brand colours:** Dark theme with teal (#14b8a6) accent

## Current Product Status (v2 — April 2026)
Nano EASM v2 is open-source and **currently free** — every paid plan is free to upgrade until further notice. Plans still exist and control feature limits, but billing and payment are disabled. Key points:

- Do **not** describe the product as a "community edition", "community preview", or "community version" anywhere in code, copy, or docs. The accepted phrasing is "free upgrades until further notice" (or shortened equivalents like "currently free", "free to use")
- Plans (Free, Starter, Professional, Enterprise Silver, Enterprise Gold, Custom) are **free upgrade tiers** — no payment is required
- All pricing, payment, subscription, checkout, and trial wording is **hidden from the UI**
- Plan limits and feature gates still enforce (assets, scans, team members, schedules, API keys, monitoring, deep discovery, webhooks)
- Real billing can be re-enabled later via a feature flag — **do not remove billing code**
- Customer base is **global** (APAC, USA, Europe, Africa, Australia) — do not pitch as Australia-only or use AU sovereignty as a primary differentiator. AUD pricing is a billing-currency choice, not a market scope statement.

## Pending Redesigns (parked 2026-05-10)

Brainstormed and agreed in principle but not yet specced or coded. Will be folded into a coordinated change later.

1. **Plan model — monitor everything you have.** `monitored_assets` will equal `assets` for every tier (no separate sub-cap). Throughput cap: ~1/3 of an org's assets scannable per day, so a full inventory sweep cycles every ~3 days. Affects `PLAN_CONFIG` in `backend/app/billing/routes.py`, the `monitored_assets` enforcement at `backend/app/auth/permissions.py:271`, the settings/billing UI, and any pricing copy that references monitored counts.

2. **Credit-based pricing.** Replaces `scans_per_month` with a credit pool. 1 scan = 1 credit (flat across Quick/Standard/Deep profiles). 1 discovery = 5 credits (~5× scan cost). Top-ups available (e.g., 500-pack, 2000-pack); no annual billing for now. Pool sizes per tier are still tunable — current `scans_per_month` numbers are the conservative floor. **Do not surface credit numbers in landing-page copy until billing is re-enabled** — they're cost-driven and will tune. Affects `PLAN_CONFIG`, `permissions.py` decorators, dashboard usage displays, the `/billing/plan` endpoint, and pricing copy.

3. **"community" framing sweep.** Apply the no-community rule (above) across all existing files. ~12 files still contain `community preview` / `community edition` references: this `CLAUDE.md`, `STRIPE.md`, frontend landing + settings/billing pages, backend billing routes, stripe service, terms-of-use legal doc, several SDLC docs.

## Tech Stack

### Backend (Flask/Python)
- **Framework:** Flask with blueprints, SQLAlchemy ORM, Flask-JWT-Extended for auth
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 (production on EC2, local dev on localhost:5432)
- **Entry point:** `backend/manage.py` → `gunicorn manage:app` in production
- **Config:** Environment variables loaded from `.env` — key one is `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`
- **Migrations:** Flask-Migrate (Alembic) in `backend/migrations/`
- **Background jobs:** APScheduler for monitoring, scan schedules, trial expiry checks

### Frontend (Next.js/TypeScript)
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Config:** `frontend/next.config.ts` with standalone output for Docker
- **API client:** `frontend/app/lib/api.ts` (all backend calls go through here)
- **Route groups:** `(authenticated)/` requires login, `(unauthenticated)/` is public

## Key Architecture Patterns

### Backend
- Each module has `routes.py` (Flask blueprints) and supporting files
- All routes return JSON with consistent error format
- Auth uses JWT tokens with role-based permissions (Viewer, Analyst, Admin, Owner)
- Plan-based limits enforced via decorators in `auth/permissions.py`
- Discovery uses an orchestrator pattern: `discovery/orchestrator.py` coordinates 12 modules
- Scanner uses an orchestrator pattern: `scanner/orchestrator.py` coordinates 9 engines → 13 analyzers
- Finding templates defined in `scanner/templates.py` (335 templates as of May 2026 — many registered via helper builders, not inline `FindingTemplate(...)` calls; count via `len(_TEMPLATES)` after import, not by grep)
- `models.py` is the single source of truth for all database tables

### Frontend
- App Router with route groups for auth separation
- `api.ts` is the central API client — all backend calls go through here
- Component pattern: pages import from `ui/`, `lib/`, and local components
- Sidebar.tsx and TopBar.tsx contain the navigation and brand logo
- `lib/billing-config.ts` exports `BILLING_ENABLED` — all billing/pricing UI is gated on this

## Platform Admin Console

A hidden superadmin area exists at `/admin`. It is not linked from anywhere in the normal UI and returns a generic 404 to non-superadmins.

### Superadmin flag
- `User.is_superadmin` boolean column (default `False`) in the database
- Only granted via Flask CLI — no UI to grant/revoke (intentional, prevents privilege escalation)

### Grant / revoke via CLI
```bash
# On the server:
flask grant-superadmin your@email.com
flask revoke-superadmin your@email.com

# In Docker:
docker compose exec easm-backend flask grant-superadmin your@email.com
```

### Admin capabilities
| Page | URL | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `/admin/dashboard` | Platform-wide stats: orgs, users, assets, scans, plan distribution |
| Organizations | `/admin/organizations` | All orgs — search, filter by plan, suspend/archive/delete. Links to org detail |
| Org Detail | `/admin/organizations/<id>` | Usage, members, plan, custom limits editor, suspend/archive/delete |
| Users | `/admin/users` | All users — search, filter by role/org/suspension. Impersonate, reset password, suspend, delete |
| Audit Log | `/admin/audit-log` | Platform-wide audit log — filter by org, category, date range, search |
| Active Scans | `/admin/scans` | Live view of scan + discovery jobs across all orgs. Auto-refreshes every 15s |
| Broadcast | `/admin/broadcast` | Send info/warning/critical announcements to all orgs or a specific org |
| Health | `/admin/health` | DB ping + pool stats, job queue depths, error rates, uptime, platform totals |
| Quick Scans | `/admin/quick-scans` | Unauthenticated quick-scan log, top IPs, rate-limit tracking, IP block list |

### Admin backend endpoints (`/admin/*`)
All return **404** for non-superadmins (do not reveal existence).
```
GET    /admin/stats                          — platform-wide counts + plan breakdown
GET    /admin/organizations                  — all orgs (paginated, searchable, filterable)
GET    /admin/organizations/<id>             — single org detail + usage + members + limits
POST   /admin/organizations/<id>/plan        — change any org's plan
POST   /admin/organizations/<id>/limits      — set per-org limit overrides (JSON column)
POST   /admin/organizations/<id>/archive     — toggle org archived/active
POST   /admin/organizations/<id>/suspend     — toggle org suspended (blocks all logins)
DELETE /admin/organizations/<id>             — hard-delete org + all data (DB cascade)
GET    /admin/users                          — all users (paginated, filterable by role/org/suspended)
POST   /admin/users/<id>/impersonate         — issue session token for user (admin acts as them)
POST   /admin/users/<id>/reset-password      — generate password reset link, optional Resend email
POST   /admin/users/<id>/suspend             — toggle user suspended
DELETE /admin/users/<id>                     — hard-delete user (DB cascade)
GET    /admin/audit-log                      — platform-wide audit log (all orgs)
GET    /admin/scans                          — active + recent scan/discovery jobs (all orgs)
GET    /admin/announcements                  — list all platform announcements
POST   /admin/announcements                  — create announcement
DELETE /admin/announcements/<id>             — delete announcement
GET    /admin/health                         — platform health stats
GET    /admin/quick-scans                    — unauthenticated quick-scan log
GET    /admin/blocked-ips                    — IP block list
POST   /admin/blocked-ips                    — block an IP (with optional reason + expiry)
DELETE /admin/blocked-ips/<id>               — unblock an IP
```

### User-facing admin endpoints (authenticated users)
```
GET  /auth/announcements   — active announcements for this user's org (shown as dismissible banners)
```

### Security model
- `require_superadmin` decorator re-fetches user from DB on every request (no JWT-only trust)
- Returns 404 (not 401/403) on failure — route appears to not exist
- All admin actions are audit-logged
- Admin grants never set `plan_expires_at` — plans don't expire
- Impersonation is audit-logged; frontend stores return session in `asm_impersonate_return` localStorage key

### Key models added for admin features
- `User.is_superadmin` — boolean, default False, grant via CLI only
- `User.is_suspended` — boolean, blocks login with `ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` 403
- `Organization.is_suspended` — boolean, blocks login for all org members
- `Organization.limit_overrides` — JSON column, merged with plan defaults in `get_effective_limits()`
- `AuditLog.organization_id` — nullable (admin actions have no org context)
- `PlatformAnnouncement` — title, body, kind (info/warning/critical), target_org_id (null=all), expires_at
- `QuickScanLog` — IP, user agent, target, status, duration, risk score, finding counts per severity
- `BlockedIP` — IP, reason, blocked_by, expires_at (null=permanent)

### Impersonation flow
1. Admin clicks impersonate on any non-superadmin user
2. Backend issues a normal session token for that user, audit-logs the action
3. Frontend saves admin session to `asm_impersonate_return`, sets `asm_impersonating` flag
4. Amber banner appears on every page: "Impersonating [name] — Exit impersonation"
5. Exit restores the admin session from localStorage and redirects to `/admin/users`

### Quick scan abuse protection
- Every unauthenticated `/quick-scan` request is logged to `quick_scan_log`
- Rate limit: 5 scans/hour per IP (checked against the log table — no Redis needed)
- Block list checked on entry; blocked IPs get 403, rate-limited get 429
- Both are logged with status `blocked` / `rate_limited`
- Admin view at `/admin/quick-scans` shows log, top IPs (24h), and block list management
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** gates `/quick-scan`, `/quick-discovery`, `/assistant/public-explain`, and `/contact-requests` (see `app/utils/turnstile.py`). Fail-open: a Cloudflare outage doesn't break the top-of-funnel — rate limit + IP block list remain in effect. When `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is unset (e.g., local dev), verification is skipped entirely.
- IPs are reported correctly behind nginx because `app/__init__.py` wires `werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix.ProxyFix(x_for=1, ...)` — `request.remote_addr` is the real client IP for rate-limit and block-list lookups.
- Public-IP filter in `app/quick_scan/routes.py` `validate()` rejects loopback, link-local (incl. AWS metadata 169.254.169.254), private (RFC1918), and reserved ranges. Defense-in-depth: the engine path currently only queries Shodan's API by IP (no direct probes), but this filter prevents SSRF if anyone adds an active probe later.

### Announcement banners
- Admin creates via `/admin/broadcast` — kind, optional body, optional target org, optional expiry
- Users see dismissible banners in the authenticated layout (above page content)
- Dismissed IDs stored in `asm_dismissed_announcements` localStorage — survives page reload

### DB migrations (apply in order)
```bash
flask db upgrade
```
Pending migrations (chain from `e4f9a2b3c1d6`):
- `f5a1b2c3d4e6` — add `platform_announcement` table
- `a1b2c3d4e5f6` — make `audit_log.organization_id` nullable
- `b1c2d3e4f5a6` — add `quick_scan_log` and `blocked_ip` tables

## Billing Feature Flag

Billing UI is controlled by a single feature flag. **Currently set to `false`.**

### Frontend flag
`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_BILLING=false` in `frontend/.env.local`

Read via `frontend/app/lib/billing-config.ts`:
```ts
export const BILLING_ENABLED = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_BILLING === "true";
```

### Backend flag
`ENABLE_BILLING=false` (env var, defaults to false if not set)

Read in `backend/app/billing/routes.py`:
```python
ENABLE_BILLING = os.environ.get("ENABLE_BILLING", "false").lower() == "true"
```

### What changes when `BILLING_ENABLED=false` (current state)
**Frontend:**
- Landing page: pricing section hidden, "Pricing" nav link hidden, hero CTA says "Get started free"
- Sidebar: "Payment & Plans" → "Plans"
- Plans page (`/settings/billing`): no prices shown, no trial buttons, upgrade buttons say "Switch to this plan", Custom shows "Contact Us" (mailto:support@nanoeasm.com)
- Monitoring upgrade prompt: no prices shown, "Switch to {plan}" instead of "Start Trial"
- TopBar and Sidebar: trial countdown badge hidden
- Register page: "No credit card required" → "Free to use"

**Backend:**
- `/billing/upgrade`: sets plan to active with no expiry date (`plan_expires_at = None`)
- Free upgrades work immediately — users click "Switch to this plan" and it takes effect

### What changes when `BILLING_ENABLED=true` (future)
- Full pricing UI restored on landing page, Plans page, and monitoring upgrade prompt
- Trial buttons restored (14/21/30/45-day trials)
- Upgrade sets `plan_expires_at` (30 days monthly, 365 days annual)
- Custom requires contacting sales (403 response from backend)
- Trial expiry scheduler downgrades orgs automatically

### Billing backend endpoints (always present, regardless of flag)
```
GET  /billing/plan        — current org plan + usage + limits
GET  /billing/plans       — all 5 plan tiers with metadata
POST /billing/start-trial — start a free trial (billing mode only)
POST /billing/upgrade     — switch to a paid/free tier
POST /billing/downgrade   — revert to Free plan
POST /billing/cancel      — cancel trial or subscription
DELETE /billing/organization — delete org (owner only)
```

### Plan tiers and limits *(updated May 2026 — repriced in AUD, Silver bumped to 10K assets, Gold bumped to 20K assets; Silver/Gold monthly cut to A$599 / A$999 for launch positioning. NOTE: see "Pending Redesigns" — plan model and `scans_per_month` will change to monitor-all + credit-pool semantics)*

All prices are in **Australian dollars (AUD)**. Per-scan/per-discovery costs further down are in USD because Shodan and EC2 are USD-billed; AUD margin is computed at 1 USD ≈ 1.55 AUD.

| Plan | Monthly | Annual /mo | Assets (inventory) | Monitored assets | Monitor freq | Scans/mo | Discoveries/mo | Members | Schedules | API Keys | Deep Discovery | Webhooks | Audit log | Priority support |
|------|---------|------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|----------|----------------|---------|-----------|----------|----------------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Free | A$0 | — | 2 | 0 | — | 5 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Starter | A$29 | A$24 | 15 | 5 | every 7d | 100 | 10 | 3 | 5 | 1 | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Professional | A$149 | A$129 | 100 | 25 | every 3d | 1,000 | 50 | 10 | 25 | 5 | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Enterprise Silver | A$599 | A$509 | 10,000 | 100 | daily | 6,000 | 200 | 50 | 100 | 10 | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Enterprise Gold | A$999 | A$849 | 20,000 | 250 | daily | 12,000 | 400 | 100 | 200 | 20 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Custom | Contact sales | — | ∞ | ∞ | hourly | ∞ | ∞ | ∞ | ∞ | ∞ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Trials are request-only** for every paid tier — clicking "Request free trial" creates a typed `contact_request` that admins review and approve manually. Admin sets the trial duration when granting (no hard-coded `trialDays`). See `POST /billing/start-trial`.

### Cost rationale (DO NOT remove caps without re-running this math)

The big lever is **monitored-assets × monitoring frequency**. A monitor is a recurring scan job — the cost compounds every cycle, forever, per customer. Earlier plan designs that said "Silver: 15,000 assets, daily monitoring, unlimited scans" would have burned thousands/mo per Silver customer in marginal cost on a sub-$300 plan. The redesigned plans separate `assets` (cheap inventory — bumped to 10K Silver / 20K Gold for positioning, since DB rows are essentially free) from `monitored_assets` (the expensive recurring dial) and cap `scans_per_month` to cover BOTH manual and monitoring traffic in one budget.

**Per-scan marginal costs in USD** (Shodan Corporate ~$0.001/credit, EC2 t2.medium near full utilisation):

| Operation | Cost (USD) | Cost (AUD ≈ ×1.55) |
|---|---|---|
| Quick scan (3–5 Shodan credits + ~5s compute) | ~$0.01 | ~A$0.015 |
| Standard scan (10–15 credits + ~30s compute) | ~$0.02 | ~A$0.031 |
| Deep scan (15–25 credits + ~120s compute) | ~$0.04 | ~A$0.062 |
| Discovery job (CT + brute + ~30s compute) | ~$0.05 | ~A$0.078 |

**Margin check per tier — AUD** (Standard-scan averages, full-quota usage; A$ = AUD):

| Tier | Price | Max scan cost | Disc cost | Hosting/Stripe | Total cost | Margin | Margin % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Starter | A$29 | A$3.10 | A$0.78 | A$0.77 | A$4.65 | A$24.35 | 84% |
| Professional | A$149 | A$31.00 | A$3.88 | A$3.10 | A$37.98 | A$111.02 | 75% |
| Enterprise Silver | A$599 | A$186.00 | A$15.50 | A$7.75 | A$209.25 | A$389.75 | 65% |
| Enterprise Gold | A$999 | A$372.00 | A$31.00 | A$15.50 | A$418.50 | A$580.50 | 58% |
| Custom | sales-priced (typical: A$3,000+/mo) | A$1,550 (capped) | — | A$46.50 | ~A$1,596.50 | sales decides | sales decides |

**Hard rules — verify against these before changing any limit:**

1. **Never give a self-serve tier `scans_per_month: -1` (unlimited).** Gold caps at 12,000 scans/mo to keep margins comfortably positive (currently ~58% at full quota). Custom is sales-priced and only that tier gets unlimited — anything resembling "unlimited everything" needs a real contract with usage caps. If Gold price moves below A$899/mo, re-run the margin table before approving — at A$899 with full-quota usage Gold would drop below 55%.
2. **Free tier never gets monitoring** — recurring scans on a $0 plan = unbounded loss.
3. **Asset count and monitored_assets are independent dials.** Inventory is cheap (DB rows — 20K assets × 2KB ≈ 40MB per org). Monitored is what bleeds.
4. **scans_per_month must mathematically cover monitoring + manual usage.** Formula: `monitored_assets × scans_per_month_per_monitored_asset_at_freq + manual_headroom`. Gold monitoring 250 assets daily = 7,500 scans/mo just for monitoring; the 12,000 cap leaves ~4,500 for manual scans.
5. **Multi-million-asset prospects are Custom-tier contracts**, not auto-provisioned via Stripe. Per-asset pricing (A$1.50–A$15/asset/mo) negotiated annually with usage caps. Don't accept "10M assets monitored hourly" via the contact form without quoting properly.
6. **API costs scale with Shodan plan tier and AUD/USD FX.** If the AUD weakens against USD or you downgrade your Shodan subscription, every margin number above shifts. Re-run the table when FX moves >10%.

### Tracking real costs

`scans_per_month` is enforced via `check_limit("scans_per_month")` on the scan-job creation route — both manual and monitoring scans count against this single budget. `monitored_assets` is enforced via `check_limit("monitored_assets")` on the monitor-creation route. `discoveries_per_month` is enforced on `POST /discovery/run`. Live counts come from `_get_current_usage()` in `app/auth/permissions.py`.

### Stripe status
Stripe is **wired but currently gated off** by `ENABLE_BILLING=false`. When enabled:
- AUD-denominated Prices for Starter / Professional / Silver / Gold (monthly + annual) live in the Stripe dashboard. Their `price_…` IDs are pasted into env vars `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER_MONTHLY` / `_ANNUAL`, `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_*`, `STRIPE_PRICE_SILVER_*`, `STRIPE_PRICE_GOLD_*` (see `app/billing/stripe_service.py` for the full key list — the env var names are currency-agnostic, so when switching currencies you just point them at AUD-denominated Prices in Stripe).
- `/billing/checkout` opens hosted Checkout. `/billing/portal` opens the Customer Portal. `/billing/stripe-webhook` is signature-verified and idempotent (each event id stored in `stripe_event` table).
- Receipts, payment-failed, and refund emails are sent from our domain via Resend (not Stripe's defaults). See `app/billing/emails.py`.
- Custom tier is **not** Stripe-purchasable — it routes to the contact form for a sales-quoted contract.

## Finding Template Catalogue

The finding-template registry (`backend/app/scanner/templates.py`) currently holds **335** curated templates. Many are registered via helper builders (`_takeover_confirmed`, `_nuclei_default_creds`, etc.) rather than inline `FindingTemplate(...)` constructors, so the authoritative count is `len(_TEMPLATES)` after import — `grep` patterns will undercount. It is documented in `docs/finding-templates.md` — a 400+ KB Markdown file containing every template's title, severity, CWE, description, remediation, references, and metadata. Used for review (with ChatGPT etc.) and as the customer-facing catalogue.

**The catalogue must stay in sync with the registry.** A regen script + pre-commit hook keep this enforced.

### Regenerate manually
```bash
python backend/scripts/generate_catalogue.py
```

### Drift check (CI / verification)
```bash
python backend/scripts/generate_catalogue.py --check
```
Exits non-zero if the catalogue is stale.

### Pre-commit hook (recommended)
The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` at the repo root runs the regen automatically when `templates.py` is staged, and runs the drift check on every commit.

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
# pre-commit run --all-files   # one-off run on the working tree
```

Without pre-commit, devs are responsible for running the regen script manually after editing `templates.py`. CI can run `python backend/scripts/generate_catalogue.py --check` to fail builds on drift.

### Key invariants
- The script never imports the Flask app context — works in lightweight CI without a database, secrets, or full deps.
- The drift check ignores the auto-generated date stamp; only semantic content drift fails.

## Compliance Framework Mappings

`backend/app/scanner/compliance_map.py` maps finding CWE IDs to controls in OWASP ASVS 4.0, CIS Controls v8, NIST CSF v2.0, PCI-DSS 4.0, SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria, and ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A. Surfaced in the finding-details panel, the findings-page filter, and the Compliance PDF report preset.

**Never claim "direct" mapping for SOC 2 or ISO 27001.** These frameworks have no machine-readable taxonomy and every claim must be derived via NIST CSF cross-walks. The code structurally enforces this — see invariants 2-4 in the test plan. Marketing copy should say *"surfaces findings that may inform your compliance evidence — verify with your auditor"*, never *"audit-ready for SOC 2"*.

## Audit Log Webhook Stream

Forwards every `audit_log` write to a customer-configured HTTP endpoint (typically a SIEM ingestion URL). Plan-gated to tiers where `PLAN_CONFIG.audit_log = True` (Enterprise Gold + Custom).

### Wiring
- Module: `backend/app/audit/webhook.py` — daemon-thread fire-and-forget POST.
- Hook: `log_audit()` in `backend/app/audit/routes.py` calls `forward_audit_event(entry, organization_id)` after the savepoint commits. The entry is **snapshotted into a plain dict** before the thread spawns — the outer transaction hasn't committed yet, so a background session can't read the row, and SQLAlchemy instances can't cross thread boundaries.
- Settings: `GET/PUT/DELETE /settings/audit-webhook`, `POST /settings/audit-webhook/test`, `GET /settings/audit-webhook/deliveries` in `backend/app/settings/routes.py`.
- UI: third tab in `frontend/app/(authenticated)/settings/integrations/page.tsx` ("Audit Log Stream"). Lower-tier orgs see an upgrade-prompt empty state, not an error.

### Delivery contract
- `POST` with JSON body, `User-Agent: Nano-EASM-Audit-Webhook/1.0`, 10 s timeout.
- `X-Nano-Signature: sha256=<hex>` — HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body using the org's secret.
- `X-Nano-Event-Id: <uuid>` — receiver-side idempotency key.
- `X-Nano-Event-Type: <category>` — convenience for routing rules.
- Body shape (snake_case — diverges from camelCase UI contract intentionally for SIEM-friendliness): `{event_id, schema_version, event_type, timestamp, organization, actor, action, category, target, description, metadata, audit_log_id}`.

### Secret handling
- Generated server-side via `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` on first save (`whsec_…`). Customer-supplied secrets are **not** allowed — prevents weak values.
- Returned in plaintext **only once** (in the PUT response on creation or rotation). Subsequent GETs return `whsec_…last4` mask.
- Rotate via `PUT { regenerateSecret: true }` — old secret immediately invalidated.

### Per-attempt log
- `audit_webhook_delivery` table records every POST, success or failed, with status code, duration, error message, and the snapshotted URL at delivery time.
- Used for the "Recent deliveries" debug panel.
- **No retries** today (retrying audit events with stale state has its own correctness issues) — the row simply records the failure.

### Failure modes
- Webhook off, plan downgraded, category filter mismatch, missing URL → silent no-op (no delivery row).
- Network/timeout/non-2xx → row recorded as `failed` with error captured.
- Forwarder crash → caught and logged; never breaks the audit-log write itself.

## Production Deployment (EC2)
- **Server:** AWS EC2 t2.medium, Ubuntu 24.04, IP 34.232.100.29
- **Directory:** ~/boltedge-easm/ on EC2
- **Containers:** easm-frontend, easm-backend, easm-db
- **Proxy:** Shared Nginx at ~/boltedge/ routes nanoeasm.com traffic
- **Deploy:** `cd ~/boltedge-easm && git pull && docker compose up -d --build`
- **Note:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are baked in at build time — env changes require `--no-cache` rebuild

## Important Rules
1. Never add BoltEdge references — the product is Nano EASM
2. Do not remove billing/payment/plan code — it is temporarily hidden by feature flag, not deleted
3. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are baked in at build time — changes require `--no-cache` rebuild
4. Database schema changes must use Flask-Migrate: `flask db migrate` then `flask db upgrade`
5. The `models.py` file is large (60KB) — be careful with changes, check foreign keys
6. All API endpoints return JSON — never return HTML from the backend
7. External API keys are optional — engines should gracefully handle missing keys
8. All billing/pricing UI changes must go through `BILLING_ENABLED` from `lib/billing-config.ts` — never hardcode pricing visibility
